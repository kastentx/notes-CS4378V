# Use Slack for Q&A
* We will spend some time on Q&A at the beginning of each class
* at the end of the semester, we will vote on who was most helpful in the chat

# Project 1
* Smaller groups will get higher scores (max size 3)
* recommended to use LaTeX for the report
  * cvpr2018 conference has a good template to use
* can be `theory` or `application` based
* NIPS and ICML are good conferences to look for topics
* kaggle has good datasets
* **DATES**
  * Proposal due: Feb 20
  * Intermediate project report due: Mar 20
  * Final Project Presentations: April 24th - May 1
  * Final Project Due: May 1
* **Deliverables**
  * code should be maintained in GitHub

# Feature Scaling
* Idea: make sure features are on a similar scale
* mean normalization
* polynomial regression
  * you can reuse features, raised to different exponents

## Gradient Descent Review
* `m` training samples
* `n` features
* `Î±` learning rate
* good for cases with lots of features
  * if there aren't enough training samples, model can **overfit** for the data
    * sometimes you might need to remove features
    * higher order function might fit data too well and be unable to make predictions
