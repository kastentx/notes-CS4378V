# Class Notes

* the math behind the ML algorithms is equally important
  * probability
  * linear algebra
    * matricies and vectors
* we will use MATLAB and Python
* reports will be written within LaTex
* GitHub will be used for our projects

## GRADING
* (30%) 4 or 5 HW assignments
* (35%) 1 research project (group of 1 to 3 students)
* (30%) 1 mid-term and 1 final exam
* (5%) participation

## History
* AI goes bacak to 1950s
* Machine Learning starts in 1980s
* Deep Learning has major impact from 2010

## ML in Daily Life
* face detection in digital cameras
* facebook auto-tagging
  * detecs face, but also attaches an identity
* Face Landmark Alignment
* Smile Detection
* Vision-based Biometrics
  * identification by iris, fingerprint, etc
* optical character recognition
  * convert scanned docs to text
* CV in sports (help refs)
* photo organization
  * google photos
* identify e-commerce products by photo
* scanning 3d models with a smartphone
* create 3d models from many images
* healthcare applications
  * minimizing the need to draw blood
  * read pulse or rate of breathing through computer vision

### What is Machine Learning?
* Field of study the gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
  * _Arthur Samuel (1959)_

### Machine Learning Framework
* Data -> Patterns -> Algorithms -> Outcome/Prediction

## Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning
* Supervised - "right answers" given
  * labels provided with the training data
  * `Regression`
  * `Classification`
* Unsupervised - "right answers" unknown
  * labels not provided with training data
  * `K-Means Clustering`
  * Cocktail Party Problem (speech/music seperation) - SVD

## Linear Regression
