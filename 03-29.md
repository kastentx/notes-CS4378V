# Unsupervised Learning
* 2 parts:
  * Clustering & Dimension Reduction (complex to simple)
  * Generation (out of nothing)

## Clustering
* group unlabelled data into clusters
  * usually represented by a vector
* how many clusters should be used?

### K-Means
* "k" refers to the number of clusters
* "cluster center" is initialized for each cluster
* distance to center is measured for each sample
  * data goes into cluster that has closest center
* center gets updated after each change
* process gets repeated many times

### Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering
* Dimension Reduction
  * take a vector with many dimensions and go to a low number of dimensions
  * helps with feature selection
* Principle Component Analysis
  * know the definition/equation for the variance
    * want to maximize this and get variance as high as possible
  * optimization done using lagrange multiplier
  * eigenvectors?
* clearly, some more linear algebra knowledge is needed here
