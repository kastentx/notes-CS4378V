# Neural Networks
* CNN are good for images
* find small parts of image... landmarks to help identify objects
* subsampling can be used to reduce the number of pixels, make image smaller
  * less parameters for nthe network to process the image
* Convolution using filters - searching for patterns
* Feature Map
